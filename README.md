I'm a Computational Neuroscience & ML researcher interested in representation learning and ML systems engineering.

Right now, my research is focused on drawing insights from cortical vision to design a deep learning model that learns interpretable visual representations. I also enjoy working on my own, from-scratch deep learning framework (currently wrapping my head around designing a Rust-based model compilation backend...).

Other stuff I'm actively exploring:
* **Deep Learning Framework Design & Compiler Optimization**
* **Neural Dynamics & Brain Criticality Theory**
