I'm a Computational Neuroscience & ML researcher interested in neural representation learning and ML systems engineering.

Right now, my research is focused on analyzing representations learned by deep learning models redesigned as neural dynamical systems. I'm also working on my own deep learning framework - building a compiler backend for it at the moment!
