I'm a Computational Neuroscience & ML researcher also interested in ML systems engineering. Right now, my research is focused on drawing insights from cortical vision to design a deep learning model that learns interpretable visual representations.

Other stuff I'm actively exploring:
* **Neural Dynamics, especially Brain Criticality Theory**
* **Deep Learning Framework Design & Compiler Optimization**
