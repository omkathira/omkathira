# Hi, I'm Om!

I'm a Computational Neuroscience & ML researcher interested in representation learning and DL systems engineering.

Right now, my research is focused on drawing insights from cortical vision to design deep learning models that learn interpretable visual representations. I also enjoy working on my own deep learning framework (tackling how I should go about designing a Rust-based DL compiler for it at the moment!).

Cool things I'm actively exploring:
* **Domain-specific Compilers for Deep Learning**
* **Neural Dynamics & Brain Criticality Theory**
