# Hi, I'm Om!

I'm a Computational Neuroscience & ML researcher interested in representation learning and ML systems engineering.

Right now, my research is focused on drawing insights from cortical vision to design a deep learning model that learns interpretable visual representations. I also enjoy working on my own deep learning framework that I built from scratch (designing a Rust-based DL compiler for it at the moment!).

Other stuff I'm actively exploring:
* **Domain-specific Compilers for Deep Learning**
* **Neural Dynamics & Brain Criticality Theory**
