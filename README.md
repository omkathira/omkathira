I'm a Computational Neuroscience & ML researcher interested in neural representation learning and ML systems engineering.

Right now, my research is focused on drawing insights from cortical vision to design deep learning models that learn interpretable visual representations. I also enjoy working on my own deep learning framework (working on building a Rust-based DL compiler for it at the moment!).

Cool things I'm actively exploring:
* **Optimizing Deep Learning Compilers**
* **Neural Dynamics & Brain Criticality Theory**
