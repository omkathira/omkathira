I'm a Computational Neuroscience & ML researcher interested in representation learning and ML systems engineering.

Right now, my research is focused on drawing insights from cortical vision to design a deep learning model that aims to learn interpretable visual representations. I also enjoy working on my own from-scratch deep learning framework (working on adding a model compilation backend at the moment!).

Other stuff I'm actively exploring:
* **Deep Learning Framework Design & Compiler Optimization**
* **Neural Dynamics & Brain Criticality Theory**
